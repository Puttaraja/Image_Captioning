# Image_Captioning

To create a model which gives textual description of events or action taking place in an image.

Feature from image are extracted using cnn model InceptionV3.

Training LSTM encoder and decoder model using these features and the captions for those features.

Validation of the model is done using BLEU score.

This model achieved 44.37% of BLEU score which indicates an efficient and good image caption generator.

Novelty : Generated caption for an image in user choosen native language.
